## About

In this project I created the example HTML sections and then wrote the JS functions that would dynamically create a navbar based off of the sections of the page.

Also, I added functionality so that the section being actively viewed is distinguished in the navbar, and clicking on any of the sections would smoothly scroll to it on the page.
